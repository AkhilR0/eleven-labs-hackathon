In high school, I used a website called FutureMe where you could send an email to yourself in the future. It was emotional and genuinely beneficial, just seeing how much I'd grown over the years.

This takes that experience and makes it way more immersive. Instead of reading a message, you actually *talk* to your past self. The app clones your voice and uses your current goals, fears, and work as context. Then you schedule a call, and your past self calls you in the future. Imagine talking to yourself from when you were younger, or even as a kid. Your voice would sound so different. Your whole personality would be different.

But if you're impatient, you can flip it: get a roleplay of your *future* self to call you right now, helping you work toward those same goals you wrote about.

Basically, you can literally travel through time in both directions.

And this isn't just a gimmick. There's actually a lot of research from therapists and studies showing this kind of thing is genuinely beneficial. Connecting with your past self helps with self-compassion and processing where you've been. Connecting with your future self helps with motivation and long-term decision making. Both directions, uniquely useful.
